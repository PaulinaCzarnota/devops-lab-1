# Lab Summaries   

### Lab 1: Bash Scripting
This lab introduces fundamental **Bash scripting** concepts through small programs designed to build intuition for shell scripting. Key topics include:  

- **Basic Commands**: Printing "Hello World", reading user input, and displaying a greeting.  
- **Algorithms**: Implementing Euclid’s algorithm to compute the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** using both user input and command-line arguments.  
- **Data Handling**: Summing multiple numbers and identifying the largest number from command-line arguments.  
- **Pattern Printing**: Generating a **Christmas tree pattern** based on a given number of rows.  
- **Execution & Validation**: Ensuring input correctness, handling errors, and demonstrating script execution across **Windows (Git Bash) and macOS/Linux (Bash/zsh)** environments.  

This lab serves as an **introduction to scripting for automation and DevOps workflows**, providing a strong foundation in **Bash programming**.
